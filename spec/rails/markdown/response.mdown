# Responses

We should be able to get the response on any request or cucumber visit or whatever

* When I go to the test page

Now that request is in the buffer so we should be able to assert some stuff

### 200 OK

For example the response code

### More

This will not do anything because the header isn't right

### HTML Response
This will and we use a list to check more things

* Status Code: 200
* Content-Type: text/html

Yeah!
